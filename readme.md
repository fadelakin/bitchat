# bitchat

bitchat is a small chat application for android akin to whatsapp.

you can't really use it unless your phone number and the person you're trying to talk to's phone number is also in the parse database. but feel free to switch out the parse keys for your own, if you'd like to test it out for yourself. 

i built this to improve my android skills and learn about polling servers for up-to-date information. ymmv.
